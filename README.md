# Investigate a Relational Database
This was the first project in Programming for Data Science with Python Nanodegree from Udacity. In this project, SQL was used to explore a database related to movie rentals. The SQL codes were written to run SQL queries and answer interesting questions about the database. Also, visualizations were built to showcase the output of the queries ([report.pdf](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/iamseyi27/udacity-pdsnd-investigate-a-relational-database/253669c0293a8e2adb1851f20dac480a48f62a6f/report.pdf)).
